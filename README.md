This is a proof of concept Agent 1.5 decompiler that decompiles the sounds and grayscal BMPs from any UNCOMPRESSED 1.5 Microsoft Agent 1.5 character.

# How to use
1. Open the program
2. Open an uncompressed ACS file
3. Watch as the frames (grayscale unless you have a custom pallette [named custompallette.bmp] in the same directory) and sounds extract.

# Why so basic?
Microsoft Agent 1.5 files are fundamentally different from Microsoft Agent 2.0 files aside from using common assets. In fact, a Microsoft Agent 1.5 ACS file is actually more similar to the older .DOC / .PPT / etc formats, as it is actually an OLE/Compound File container unlike Agent 2.0 files or even Microsoft Actor 1.0 and 2.0 files.

# Compile Instructions
NOTE: This program was coded in Visual Studio 2017 and uses .NET 4.0 Framework.
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Compile/build the program!
